        Hendrik Johannes Cruijff (internationally known as Johan Cruyff; 25 April 1947 â€“ 24 March 2016), was a Dutch professional 
      football player and manager. As a player, he won the Ballon d'Or three times, in 1971, 1973 and 1974. Cruyff was a proponent of the 
      football philosophy known as Total Football explored by Rinus Michels. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest players in the
      history of the sport, as well as one of its best managers ever. He is also considered to be one of the most influential figures in 
      modern football.
